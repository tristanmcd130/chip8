Give a ROM filename as the 1st argument to load and run it. -d as the 2nd argument enables debug mode, which steps through each instruction and prints register values. It passes pretty much all of the tests from [this suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite/tree/main), but I think the timers are messed up.
